# Security Policy

## Supported Versions and Upstream Reporting

Each helm chart currently supports the designated application version in the Chart.yaml. There is a chance a security issue you've discovered may not be with the helm chart but with the upstream application. Please visit that application's Security policy document to find out how to report the security issue.

## Reporting a Vulnerability for Argo Helm Charts

We have enabled the ability to privately report security issues through the  Security tab above.

[Here are the details on how to file](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability#privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability) on how to do that

A repository owner/maintainer will respond as fast as possible to coordinate confirmation of issue and remediation.

Thank you for helping to ensure this code stays secure.
